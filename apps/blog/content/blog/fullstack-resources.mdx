If you've met me—or even skimmed through my GitHub—you already know one thing: my world revolves around TypeScript. It's the language I reach for whether I'm spinning up a quick prototype, architecting a large SaaS product, or hacking together a random side project at 2 a.m.

Over the years I've refined a tech stack that helps me move fast, stay safe, and ship real products without drowning in complexity. Here's a breakdown of what I use, why I use it, and when each tool shines.

---

## 🎨 Frontend: TypeScript All the Way Down

### **React (Core UI Workhorse)**

React remains my foundational UI library. Not because it's trendy, but because:

* the ecosystem is massive,
* the patterns are flexible,
* and honestly, hooks just feel like muscle memory now.

### **Next.js (Production-Ready React)**

When I need a strong convention-driven environment—routing, server actions, image optimization, caching layers—**Next.js** is my default.
Perfect for:

* SaaS dashboards
* Marketing sites
* SEO-heavy pages
* Hybrid SSR/ISR experiences

### **TanStack Start (The New Kid I'm Loving)**

A fresh, modern take on app routing grounded in TanStack Router.
Why I like it:

* File-based routing without the Next.js magic
* Progressive enhancement baked in
* Great for SPAs with sprinkles of server logic

### **Astro (Island-Based Performance Beast)**

When perf matters more than interactivity, I reach for **Astro**.
It's my go-to for:

* Documentation websites
* Content-heavy blogs
* Landing pages with tiny hydration footprints

---

## ⚙️ Backend: TypeScript From Edge to Cloud

I treat backend the same way I treat frontend: typed, fast, and flexible.

### **Elysia (The Bun-Optimized Powerhouse)**

I reach for **Elysia** when using Bun or when I want extreme performance with a smart plugin ecosystem and great DX.

### **Hono (My Go-To Edge Framework)**

Tiny, lightning-fast, Cloudflare-friendly.
If I'm deploying to the edge, I'm using **Hono**.


---

## 🖥️ Runtimes: Node, Deno, Bun

### **Node.js**

Still my default runtime for production unless I explicitly need edge or Bun optimizations.

### **Deno**

Secure by default, incredibly modern, great for small serverless functions or scripts.

### **Bun**

Fast as hell. Fantastic for:

* local dev
* tooling
* high-performance microservices with Elysia

---

## 🗂️ Databases & Storage Layer

I've used a lot of databases across projects and these are the ones I keep coming back to:

### **Convex (My Favorite Realtime DB/Backend-as-a-Service)**

It handles data, queries, functions, auth glue—all in typed TypeScript.
For dashboards and apps needing reactive data: unmatched.

### **Supabase (Firebase Alternative, But SQL)**

Perfect for:

* auth + storage
* easy SQL
* real-time features
* edge functions

### **Neon (Serverless Postgres Done Right)**

Great for multi-branch development. I love its:

* auto-suspend
* branching model
* Postgres ecosystem compatibility

### **PlanetScale (MySQL + Branch-Everywhere Joy)**

If I need MySQL with world-class DX, branching workflows, and horizontal scale, PlanetScale is the answer.

### **Turso (SQLite at the Edge)**

For:

* blazing-fast reads
* distributed edge workloads
* simple, low-latency apps

---

## 🛠️ SaaS Tools I Use Daily

### **Clerk (Authentication Done Properly)**

The best developer experience for auth.
Typed, flexible, and integrates beautifully with workflows.

### **WorkOS (Enterprise-Grade Auth & Compliance)**

Whenever SSO or anything “enterprise” enters the chat, WorkOS is my easy button.

### **PostHog (Analytics & Feature Flags)**

Self-hostable, privacy-friendly, and perfect for:

* product analytics
* feature rollouts
* session replays

### **Sentry (Error Monitoring & Performance)**

Great crash reporting on both frontend and backend.

### **AWS (Big Iron Cloud Stuff)**

When I need:

* S3
* Lambda
* CloudFront
* or something with long-term reliability

I still lean on AWS.

## ✍️ Typography Choices (Because Developers Have Taste Too)

Fonts matter. They can change the entire vibe of a product. Here's my personal rulebook:

### **🧾 Receipts, Terminal Displays**

**Departure Mono**
A pixel-perfect monospaced font I use whenever something needs that retro-printer aesthetic.

### **💻 Code & Technical UI**

**JetBrains Mono**
Clean, readable, great ligatures—my default coding font.

### **📰 Headers & Hero Sections**

**Instrument Sans** or **DM Sans**
Both have premium vibes and look amazing for feature titles or clean headers.

### **📄 Body Text (Docs, Product UI)**

**Geist** or **Inter**
Readable, neutral, and modern.
These make UIs feel professional without drawing unnecessary attention to themselves.

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

My stack is always evolving, but one thing stays constant: **I optimize for developer experience, velocity, and type-safe correctness**.
TypeScript ties my entire workflow together—from React components to backend functions to database queries.

If you're building in 2026 and want a stack that feels cohesive, modern, and insanely productive, I can't recommend this ecosystem enough.
